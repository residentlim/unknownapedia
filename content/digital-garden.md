Since its inception, the internet has always been considered the next step of personal knowledge management. The decentralized nature of the internet allows anyone to create a website, write their own content and carve out a personal space.

This dates back to 1998, when Mark Bernstein introduced the idea of ["hypertext gardens"](https://www.eastgate.com/garden/Enter.html). They were spaces on the internet that allowed a user to explore a website through hypertext links.

> Since most hypertext aims neither for the wilderness of unplanned content, nor for the straight rows of formal organization, gardens ... can inspire a new approach to hypertext design and can help us understand the patterns we observe in fine hypertext writing.

Actually, the idea of "connected knowledge" was envisioned even before the internet existed. Vannevar Bush published an essay titled "As We May Think" in The Atlantic in 1945. He described a hypothetical device that would compress and store information from books, records and communications. It would serve as an "enlarged intimate supplement to (an individual's) memory".

This device would be called the "memex" (a portmanteau of *memory* and *expansion*). Besides storing information, the memex would let users create "associative trails" of knowledge linking entries together, depicting a user's thought process.

> Wholly new forms of encyclopedias will appear, ready made with a mesh of associative trails running through them, ready to be dropped into the memex and there amplified.

> The physician, puzzled by a patient's reactions, strikes the trail established in studying an earlier similar case, and runs rapidly through analogous case histories, with side references to the classics for the partinent anatomy and histology.
